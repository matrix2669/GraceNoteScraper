Run `go test ./...` for setup, configuration, provider-client, Lineuparr builder, and Dispatcharr match-review tests.

## Architecture

The binary is a single Go process that scrapes GraceNote/TMS for 14 days of TV listings and serves the data as XMLTV over HTTP. Runtime orchestration lives in `main.go`; setup handlers live in `setup.go` and persisted configuration lives in `appconfig/`.

**Data flow:**

1. `/setup` uses `web.ProviderClient` to discover Gracenote lineups by country and postal code. `appconfig.Store` persists the selected non-secret source in `config.json`; complete legacy `GN_*` settings can bootstrap it.
2. `web.Client.GetDataByTime` fetches 6-hour grid slices from the GraceNote API (`tvlistings.gracenote.com/api/grid`) — 56 slots for 14 days. A 5-second sleep separates requests. Raw JSON types live in `web/web.go`.
3. `guide.ConvertChannel` / `guide.ConvertEvent` translate the raw JSON into `guide.TVGuide` (internal canonical types). `TVGuide.LineupChannels` separately retains every raw provider position for the Lineuparr builder; the XMLTV `Channels` list may still collapse repeated Gracenote station IDs. The `guide.tmpl` template renders XMLTV. `index.html`, `setup.html`, `lineuparr.html`, and `guide.tmpl` are embedded at build time via `//go:embed`.
4. `tmdb.Client.Lookup` enriches programs (poster images, ratings, overview, year) via TMDB search API. Deduplicates by `(title, isMovie)` before hitting the API. Rate-limited to ~4 req/sec.
5. `tvlogo.Client.Resolve` replaces Gracenote channel icons with verified PNGs from `github.com/tv-logo/tv-logos`. Generates candidate URL slugs from callsign/affiliate name and HEAD-checks each (rate-limited to ~5 req/sec).
6. `fixDeadImageURLs` rewrites `zap2it.tmsimg.com` → `tmsimg.com` for broken Gracenote image URLs.
7. If `BASE_URL` is set, all image URLs are rewritten to route through the local `/img` proxy endpoint.
8. `/lineuparr` builds a source-aware draft from the active lineup. `lineuparr/` derives exact Gracenote aliases, merges unique exact catalog/iptv-org identities, applies source-fingerprint-scoped user choices, suggests only quality-marked SD/HD duplicates, and emits the Lineuparr `categories` JSON shape. Remote enrichment is optional and cannot block the guide.
9. `dispatcharr/` optionally authenticates to Dispatcharr with username/password or an API key, pages through non-stale streams from active M3U accounts, immediately discards URL/logo/token/statistic fields, and proposes exact or bounded fuzzy matches. Stream identities normalize only delimited maintained provider prefixes and strip a leading channel number only when Dispatcharr's own `stream_chno` proves it. Confirm/deny decisions are always explicit, scoped to the active lineup plus durable normalized stream/channel identity rather than authentication method, reversible, and applied by `lineuparr/` as attributable aliases/EPG IDs only after confirmation. Browser evidence labels target-known TVG IDs separately from additional provider IDs and preserves raw-name/account provenance.

**Caching layers:**

| Cache | File | TTL |
|---|---|---|
| Guide (in-memory + disk) | `guide_cache.json` | 4h (startup skip) / 24h (rescrape) |
| TMDB lookups | `tmdb_cache.json` | 7 days |
| TV logo HEAD checks | `tvlogo_cache.json` | persisted, no expiry |
| Image proxy | `image_cache/` dir | indefinite (per-URL SHA256 key) |
| Lineuparr source data | `lineuparr_source_cache/` dir | 24h fresh; stale fallback on refresh failure |
| Dispatcharr stream metadata | memory only | 5 minutes; visible stale fallback on refresh failure |

`lineuparr_state.json` is not an enrichment cache. It stores explicit inclusion/category choices, alias suppressions, and Dispatcharr match decisions, and is ignored automatically when the active Gracenote source fingerprint changes. `dispatcharr_config.json` is a separate connection file created with mode `0600` on POSIX systems and excluded from Git and Docker build context; JWTs and stream URLs are never persisted.

**Server mode startup logic:** The HTTP server starts even without a provider so `/setup` is always recoverable. `/` redirects to setup until a valid source exists. If `xmlguide.xmltv` and a source-matching `guide_cache.json` both exist and the cache is under 4 hours old, the initial scrape is skipped. Otherwise a background scrape is queued. A `sync.RWMutex`-guarded `GuideState` holds the live guide, and `appconfig.Store.WhileCurrent` prevents an old scrape from publishing after a provider change.

**Jellyfin integration:** Optional. When `JELLYFIN_URL` + `JELLYFIN_API_KEY` are set, three extra routes are registered (`/api/livetv/channels`, `/api/livetv/tune`, `/api/livetv/stop`). The tune flow does a 3-step Jellyfin handshake (PlaybackInfo → LiveStreams/Open → build master.m3u8 URL) with a hardcoded 4-second delay before returning the HLS URL. Channel filter (`JELLYFIN_CHANNEL_FILTER`) reduces the guide to only channels Jellyfin has in its live TV lineup, matched by channel number.

**Image proxy allowlist:** Only `image.tmdb.org`, `tmsimg.com`, and `raw.githubusercontent.com/tv-logo/tv-logos/` paths are proxied. All other URLs return 403.
