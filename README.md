# GraceNote XMLTV Scraper

Generate XMLTV guide data from GraceNote/TMS listings for use with Jellyfin, Plex, Emby, TVHeadend, and other DVR/IPTV software.

## Features

- Scrapes 14 days of GraceNote/TMS program listings and outputs standard XMLTV format
- Enriches programs with TMDB poster images, ratings, descriptions, and release dates
- Enriches channel icons via the [tv-logo/tv-logos](https://github.com/tv-logo/tv-logos) project
- Runs as a long-lived server with automatic 24-hour refresh, or as a one-shot scrape for cron jobs
- First-run ZIP/postal-code setup with cable, satellite, and over-the-air lineup selection
- On-demand, resumable station-alias discovery across ranked representative US markets
- Guide data cached on disk — fast restarts without re-scraping
- Automatic XMLTV file rotation with 7-day retention
- Optional Jellyfin Live TV integration with in-browser streaming
- Optional channel filter to limit guide output to Jellyfin-available channels
- Bonus: built-in retro TV guide web UI ("The Grid")

## Jellyfin / Plex Setup

1. Run the scraper in server mode (see below).
2. Open `http://<your-host>:8080/setup` and choose your provider lineup.
3. When the first guide finishes building, add an XMLTV guide source in your DVR software pointing to:
   ```
   http://<your-host>:8080/xmlguide.xmltv
   ```
4. Guide data refreshes automatically every 24 hours.

Alternatively, use `--guide-only` mode with a cron job and point your DVR software at the local `xmlguide.xmltv` file.

## Quick Start (Docker Compose)

1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/daniel-widrick/GraceNoteScraper.git
   cd GraceNoteScraper
   ```

2. Copy the environment file for optional integrations:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   # Optionally add a TMDB token, Jellyfin settings, or legacy GN_* settings
   ```

3. Start the container:
   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. Open `http://<your-host>:8080/setup`, enter your ZIP or postal code, and choose a provider lineup.

5. After the first guide finishes building, point your DVR software at `http://<your-host>:8080/xmlguide.xmltv`.

Setup, guide data, caches, and images are persisted in a Docker volume. The container restarts automatically and refreshes guide data every 24 hours.

To view logs:
```sh
docker compose logs -f
```

To rebuild after pulling updates:
```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose, **or** Go 1.25+ for building from source
- (Optional) A [TMDB API read access token](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) for poster images and metadata

## Building from Source

If you prefer to run without Docker:

```sh
go build -o gracenotescraper .
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env
./gracenotescraper
```

### Scrape-only mode

Scrapes once, writes `xmlguide.xmltv` to the working directory, and exits. Useful for cron-based setups where you don't need the server running.

Run server mode once to save a provider through `/setup`, or provide complete legacy `GN_*` settings, before using this mode.

```sh
./gracenotescraper --guide-only
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `CONFIG_PATH` | Saved non-secret setup configuration | `config.json` |
| `MARKET_INDEX_PATH` | Saved station/alias observations from on-demand market scans | `market_index.json` |
| `MARKET_ZIPS_PATH` | Optional replacement for the embedded representative-market catalog | embedded catalog |
| `GN_HEADEND` | Legacy/bootstrap GraceNote headend ID; use with `GN_LINEUP` and `GN_ZIPCODE` | — |
| `GN_LINEUP` | Legacy/bootstrap full lineup string | — |
| `GN_COUNTRY` | Country code | `USA` |
| `GN_ZIPCODE` | Legacy/bootstrap ZIP or postal code | — |
| `GN_LANGUAGE` | Language code | `en-us` |
| `GN_DEVICE` | Device identifier | `-` |
| `TMDB_TOKEN` | TMDB read access token (optional) | — |
| `BASE_URL` | Server base URL — rewrites XMLTV image URLs to use the built-in proxy cache (e.g. `http://192.168.1.50:8080`) | — |
| `PORT` | HTTP server port | `8080` |
| `JELLYFIN_URL` | Jellyfin server URL (optional — enables live TV integration) | — |
| `JELLYFIN_API_KEY` | Jellyfin API key | — |
| `JELLYFIN_CHANNEL_FILTER` | Set to any non-empty value to filter guide to only Jellyfin-available channels. Requires `JELLYFIN_URL` and `JELLYFIN_API_KEY`. | — |

A saved `CONFIG_PATH` selection takes precedence over legacy `GN_*` settings. Delete or move that file if you intentionally want to bootstrap from environment settings again.

## Station Alias Discovery

The Alias discovery section on `/setup` builds a local station-name index only when you ask it to. It does not run at startup or on the guide-refresh schedule.

- The embedded catalog contains one representative central-city ZIP for each of the top 100 publicly reported 2025-26 US television markets. These ZIPs are discovery seeds, not official market boundaries or ZIP-to-DMA assignments.
- **Scan first/next 25 markets** creates a checkpoint and then pauses so marginal yield can be reviewed before continuing.
- Provider results are deduplicated by lineup ID before grid retrieval. Gracenote's postal-specific OTA placeholder is keyed by ZIP so different local broadcast lineups remain distinct.
- Each previously unseen lineup uses one six-hour grid slice. Only provider, lineup, station ID, channel number, and observed-name provenance are retained; programme events are discarded.
- Failed or stopped batches resume from incomplete lineups. **Refresh** deliberately rescans one market. **Rebuild index** first preserves the prior file at `<MARKET_INDEX_PATH>.bak`.
- Meaningful aliases are punctuation/case-normalized callsigns observed on the same Gracenote station ID. Affiliate/network names and callsigns used by multiple station IDs are reported separately.

The default catalog and its provenance are in `marketindex/market_zips.json`. Set `MARKET_ZIPS_PATH` to a compatible catalog if you want to maintain a different list without rebuilding the binary.

## HTTP Endpoints

|---|---|
| `GET /setup` | Choose or change the active provider lineup |
| `GET /api/setup/config` | Read the current non-secret lineup selection |
| `GET /api/setup/providers?postalCode=...` | Find Gracenote lineups for an area |
| `POST /api/setup/provider` | Save the selected provider and queue a fresh guide |
| `GET /api/setup/market-index` | Read market-scan progress and marginal alias yield |
| `POST /api/setup/market-index/run` | Continue, selectively refresh, or rebuild the on-demand index |
| `POST /api/setup/market-index/stop` | Stop a running batch safely |
| `GET /xmlguide.xmltv` | XMLTV guide data (point your DVR here) |
| `GET /api/guide.json` | Guide data as JSON |
| `GET /` | The Grid — built-in web UI |
| `GET /img?url=...` | Image proxy with local cache |
| `GET /api/livetv/config` | Returns `{"enabled":true/false}` — whether Jellyfin live TV is configured |
| `GET /api/livetv/channels` | Proxies Jellyfin channel list (requires `JELLYFIN_URL` and `JELLYFIN_API_KEY`) |
| `GET /api/livetv/tune?id=<channelId>` | Starts a live stream for the given channel and returns an HLS URL |
| `POST /api/livetv/stop` | Forwards a playback-stop notification to Jellyfin to end a live stream |

## The Grid

The server includes a built-in retro-styled TV guide web UI at the root URL. If no provider is configured, `/` redirects to `/setup`. Once configured, the guide auto-scrolls through your channel lineup and shows program details, posters, and metadata. Handy for a quick glance at what's on without opening your DVR app.
